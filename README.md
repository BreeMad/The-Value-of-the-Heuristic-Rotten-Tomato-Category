# The Value of the Heuristic Rotten Tomato Category

## Objective
Provide a clear, data-driven view of sales performance for a B2B computer hardware company by analyzing sales pipeline data from Maven Analytics.
This dashboard helps business stakeholders:

+ Monitor key sales KPIs

+ Identify top and underperforming agents and teams

+ Evaluate product-level win rates

+ Track quarter-over-quarter revenue trends

## Key Business Questions
+ How is each sales team performing compared to the rest?

+ Are any sales agents lagging behind?

+ Are there any quarter-over-quarter trends in revenue or win rates?

+ Do any products have better win rates?

+ Where is revenue concentrated (accounts, agents, regions, sectors)?

+ How efficient are sales processes (deal size vs. sales cycle time)?

## Recommendations
+ Focus coaching and resources on underperforming agents to close performance gaps.

+ Prioritize high-performing products with higher win rates to increase overall conversion.

+ Investigate teams or regions with longer average sales cycles to improve efficiency.

+ Use the dashboard regularly to monitor revenue concentration and reduce risk from overreliance on a small number of accounts or agents.

## Tools and Techniques
+ Power BI: Data modeling, relationships, DAX measures, interactive visuals

+ DAX: Created measures for revenue, win rate, average deal size, average sales cycle days, and quarter-over-quarter growth.

+ Data Modeling: Connected multiple tables (accounts, products, sales pipeline, sales agents) into a star schema.

+ Interactive Features: Dynamic slicers (manager, region, sector), drill-throughs, performance commentary.

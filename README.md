## Objective
This study intends to focus on whether the heuristic tomato category has value, even when consumers are fully informed when it comes to opening weekend box office revenues. In theory they shouldn’t.

## Research Question
Do fully-informed consumers respond to heuristics? 

## The Main Takeaways
+ No presence of perfect manipulation. 
  
+ Nothing else changing at the cutoff.

+ Most of the estimates weren’t very significant.
